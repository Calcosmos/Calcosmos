Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a software developer with expertise in web development, machine learning, and quantum computing. My current projects focus on improving educational experiences and exploring emerging technologies in various fields.

I am currently working on **RawƒÅsikh**, a platform designed to enhance student learning through active recall, spaced repetition, and gamification. The goal is to create an efficient, personalized study experience for students and educators. Additionally, I am working on a research project in **Quantum Financial Modeling**, exploring the applications of quantum computing in finance, and developing **digital chemistry experiments** to aid in the visualization and understanding of chemical reactions.

My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, C++, and web technologies like Node.js, React, Express, and Django. I also work with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, and have experience in quantum computing with tools like Qiskit. On the backend, I utilize databases like MongoDB and SQL, while also working with Docker and Git for version control and deployment.

I am particularly interested in applying machine learning and quantum computing to real-world challenges in education, finance, and data analysis. I also have a keen interest in the development of educational tools that foster more effective and engaging learning experiences.

If you're interested in discussing any of my projects or potential collaboration opportunities, please feel free to get in touch.
